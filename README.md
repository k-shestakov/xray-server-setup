```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k-shestakov/xray-server-setup/refs/heads/main/server_setup.sh)
```

Generate minimal config and start Xray without server setup:
```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k-shestakov/xray-server-setup/refs/heads/main/xray_setup.sh)
```
